    <h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm doing this whole music thing since autumn 2021, so I'm pretty new to this. As you might have noticed I'm making a wide variety of different music genres. However, I decided to settle on Music that puts focus on Synthesizers, of course Synthwave is a good fit for that. I also love if my songs can emit a feeling or tell a story that a wide variety of people can understand without a single word of lyric.</p>

<p> Basically: Your Emotions work like a one way mirror, only you can see through them, music will turn them into the clearest window on this planet so that everyone can see the other side.</p>

<h3>Me as a person</h3>
<p>To keep it short, I'm born in 2003 and living in the German city of Hannover. I decided to not study at a university and start in the working world with an apprenticeship. That said, I work as an IT-Specialist and I think I'll happily follow this profession for the rest of my life. </p>

<h3>Other hobbies</h3>
<p>As you might be able to imagine, this whole music thing takes up a whole lot of time combined with my work. I also find myself gaming a lot of the times, and generally doing a lot of IT stuff I'm interested in (for example creating a website :D). I also really love to fix any electronic devices that happen to break around my apartment and as per usual playing IT-Support for my whole family.</p>
